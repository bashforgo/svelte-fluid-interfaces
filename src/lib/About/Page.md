# About this project

This small personal project was an exploration into using animations to create fun, engaging, and delightful user experiences on the web.

It implements the 8 animation examples outlined in [Nathan Gitter's article on Building Fluid Interfaces][building-fluid-interfaces].

I built this project using [Svelte][svelte], a new framework that compiles components into highly optimized vanilla JavaScript. Svelte made it easy to create reusable components for each section.

This was just a fun way for me to experiment with some web animation techniques and get more familiar with Svelte. Feel free to poke around and view source! Let me know if you have any questions or feedback.
